## Concept Statement
The goal is to manage and build your puppy spa. You begin with a simple spa. You will have to manage customers to satisfy their needs by moving them between stations. Their satisfaction is marked by their happiness meters. You can earn money and use that to upgrade your amenities. Additionally, there are levels where within a certain time frame the player needs to make a fixed revenue. Players have two sources of motivation - improving and designing their spas and levelling up. This game will be fun because players have to strategize how to best coordinate their customers to optimize satisfaction. They also have a monetary score to keep track off. They need to make decisions regarding the return on investments on purchases that could improve services and lead to profit but will have high up-front costs.

## Game World Fiction
This game takes place at a resort in Atlantis, a popular tropical getaway. The resort is particularly family friendly, and often families do not want to leave their puppies behind. So, a puppy spa was founded by the main character’s mother to care for and pamper the visitors’ puppies. Under her mother’s care, the spa grew to be extremely popular--even becoming so well known that families would choose the resort because of the amazing facilities they could take advantage of to have their puppies join them in the relaxing vacation, as well as receive specialized care while the humans got to explore more of the resort. Unfortunately, a few years ago, the main character’s mother fell ill and the spa was managed by the resort. During this period, the spa became less popular as everything about the spa became streamlined, commercialized, and less personable. When her mother died, the resort transferred the management to the main character: the player. The resort left a few of the basic stations for the player’s use. The game follows the main player’s quest to restore Vanity Fur to its former glory, and thus protect the legacy of her late mother.

## Core Gameplay
There are three types of game objects: the player, the customers, and the stations. The player can be moved from and to stations by clicking on the station. The customers can be moved to and from stations by clicking on the customer and then the station. The stations can be operated by moving a customer and the player there. The core struggle of the game is time and resource management. The player can only move so quickly, and operating a station takes a certain amount of time. There are a limited number of stations and generally customers outnumber the stations, depending on the level and time of day. The customers only have so much patience and will leave if not helped. If they leave, they will not pay money. Customers who are helped faster will also pay more money at the end. This creates an environment of urgency where the player must move quickly and efficiently in order to serve the most amount of customers and earn the most amount of money. Money is important to the progression of the game because it can be used to purchase upgrades and make the game easier.
