## Game World Fiction
This game takes place at a resort in Atlantis, a popular tropical getaway. The resort is particularly family friendly, and often families do not want to leave their puppies behind. So, a puppy spa was founded by the main character’s mother to care for and pamper the visitors’ puppies. Under her mother’s care, the spa grew to be extremely popular--even becoming so well known that families would choose the resort because of the amazing facilities they could take advantage of to have their puppies join them in the relaxing vacation, as well as receive specialized care while the humans got to explore more of the resort. Unfortunately, a few years ago, the main character’s mother fell ill and the spa was managed by the resort. During this period, the spa became less popular as everything about the spa became streamlined, commercialized, and less personable. When her mother died, the resort transferred the management to the main character: the player. The resort left a few of the basic stations for the player’s use. The game follows the main player’s quest to restore Vanity Fur to its former glory, and thus protect the legacy of her late mother.
